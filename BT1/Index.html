                Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Barclays buy into project
                In a positive sign for long-term investors in the crypto space, Goldman Sachs and Barclays have just tied up a deal to invest $500 million in Elwood Technologies - an institutional crypto investment platform.
                
                The firm, founded by billionaire Alan Howard, is focused on providing crypto investment solutions to institutional investors and comes despite widespread market troubles in recent months. A series of other venture capital firms including Dawn Capital and Galaxy Digital (TSX-V:GLXY).
                
                The move is an interesting moment in the market, beset by the noise of turmoil in crypto prices. It shows that behind the scenes the work of major institutional players is going ahead despite the adversity. 
                
                Major movers and shakers such as Goldman and Barclays are clearly looking at the growing relevance of institu
                The high-speed decline of crypto assets over the past two weeks appears to have come to a stop for now. 

                
                Bitcoin saw a major sell-off last week, having started above US$33,800 before reaching as low as US$26,350 on the eToro platform on Thursday. The coin recovered some ground over the weekend however and is now trading between US$29,000 and US$30,000.
                
                Ether likewise saw its value plummet from around US$2,500 to below US$1,800 before rebounding to now trade around US$2,000.
                
                These falls cap a week many have now described as the beginning of a “crypto winter.” But with the so-called death spiral now halted, investors will be keen to see if tokens can maintain their price levels for the next few days at least.
                
                The last time the market faced adversity like this was the collapse of 2018. But the makeup of the market is very different today than four years ago. Institutional investors now make up a much bigger proportion of the market, which has already had an observable impact on not just prices, but the way the market moves.
